# Housing Data Analysis via ML Classification

This repository contains the code and analysis for a classification project using a housing dataset. The dataset consists of various features such as crime rate, zoning information, and property values (MEDV). The goal of the project is to classify and housing data based on these features using machine learning algorithms. The code primarily focuses on data exploration, visualization, and model evaluation using various machine learning algorithms for classification.
